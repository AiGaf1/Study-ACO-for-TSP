# Study-ACO-for-TSP
Study of the effectiveness of the parameters of the ant colony optimization(ACO) for travel salesman problem(TSP)

The best performance of ant colony optimization (ACO) largely depends on the appropriate settings; therefore, their choice of ACO is important. In this repository, we will study the dependence of the quality of the task solution of the traveling salesman problem from the values of the algorithm parameters α and β.
